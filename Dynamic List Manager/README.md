This program manages a list of people, where each person has a name, last name, height, and age. It uses commands from an input file to add, remove, or find people in the list. The list automatically adjusts its size: it grows when more space is needed and shrinks when space is freed up.

The main features include:

Adding Entries: You can insert new people at the start, the end, or a specific position in the list.
Removing Entries: You can delete people from the start, the end, or a chosen position in the list.
Searching: The program lets you search for a person by name and returns their position in the list.
Memory Management: It efficiently uses and frees memory to avoid wasting resources.
The program outputs the contents and details of the list and can print information like the number of people and the list's capacity. It also supports deleting the entire list, freeing all the memory it uses.
